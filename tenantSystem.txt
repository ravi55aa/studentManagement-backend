Shared DB + tenantId filter

From JWT token
{ userId, tenantId }



Multi_tenant Flow
------------------
STEP 1 — User Registers (Admin Signup)

    This is the first user of the school.
    They are the tenant owner.

        They provide:

            Admin name

            Admin email

            Admin phone

            Admin password

    👉 At this point, school does NOT exist yet.
    👉 Only the admin user is created.

    Backend steps:
        1.Create Admin user
        2.Generate JWT containing:
            userId,
            role: "admin",
            tenantId: null (because school not created yet)
        3.Login the admin and redirect to Create School page
