✔ Controller

    Receives the request (req.body)

    Calls the service

    Sends response



✔ Service (Business Logic Layer)

    Validates data

    Applies rules

    Calls repository

    NEVER touches the DB directly



✔ Repository (Data Access Layer)

    Directly interacts with MongoDB using models

    No business logic here

    Only CRUD operations



✔ Model

    Mongoose schema

    Object shape definitions
